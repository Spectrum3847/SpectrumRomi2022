# SpectrumRomi2022
Romi Starter project using Spectrum's library and structure.

2022 Beta 2 how to run romi
Have to comment out 4 lines in the build.gradle file (will already be done if download SpectrumRomi project)
Have to simulateJava from gradle command and not VScode - https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/issues/3725#issuecomment-973656748
“The best way to do this is there is a command in the VS Code Command Palette called WPILib: Run a command in Gradle. Run that, and in the prompt enter simulateJava. “
